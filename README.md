# Loan-EDA

Checked the shape of the data and the missing values

handled the missing values by categorical data by filling them with the lower feature as it did not make an impact.

dropped the rest as it was very low percentage 

handled the outliers by making any value under lower bound equal to the lower bound and any value more than the upper bound equal to the upper bound.

checked the corrleation and found out the there is strong relation betweeen the applicant income and the loan amount.
